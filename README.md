This is a basic, top-down view rpg game. 
It allows for collection and use of different types of items.
(Armor, Weapons, HealthItems, Notes)
As well as different types of enemies to battleand different areas to travel to. 
In the near future, there will be a more complex and unique take on 
the turn-based fight system. 
I also plan on adding new areas, items and things to interact with in the world.

You play as a knight in the Candy Kingdom (loosely based off of a popular board game)
Your mission is to fight evil vegetables in pursuit of saving the princess of the kingdom.
Your final challenge will be fighting and defeating E.V.I.L. Dentist Jamal.
Will you be able to save the kingdom, or will other emotions get in the way ;).
